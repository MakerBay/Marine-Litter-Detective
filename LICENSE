CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2 
2	
Preamble
Through this CERN Open Hardware Licence ("CERN OHL") version 1.2, CERN
wishes to provide a tool to foster collaboration and sharing among
hardware designers.  The CERN OHL is copyright CERN. Anyone is welcome
8	
to use the CERN OHL, in unmodified form only, for the distribution of
9	
their own Open Hardware designs. Any other right is reserved. Release
10	
of hardware designs under the CERN OHL does not constitute an
11	
endorsement of the licensor or its designs nor does it imply any
12	
involvement by CERN in the development of such designs.
13

1. Definitions
15	
16	
In this Licence, the following terms have the following meanings:
17	
 
18	
“Licence” means this CERN OHL.
19	
20	
“Documentation” means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit
21	
board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive text,
22	
and other explanatory material that is explicitly stated as being made
23	
available under the conditions of this Licence. The Documentation may
24	
be in any medium, including but not limited to computer files and
25	
representations on paper, film, or any other media.
26	
27	
“Documentation Location” means a location where the Licensor has
28	
placed Documentation, and which he believes will be publicly
29	
accessible for at least three years from the first communication to
30	
the public or distribution of Documentation.
31	
32	
“Product” means either an entire, or any part of a, device built using
33	
the Documentation or the modified Documentation.
34	
35	
“Licensee” means any natural or legal person exercising rights under
36	
this Licence.
37	
38	
“Licensor” means any natural or legal person that creates or modifies
39	
Documentation and subsequently communicates to the public and/ or
40	
distributes the resulting Documentation under the terms and conditions
41	
of this Licence.
42	
43	
A Licensee may at the same time be a Licensor, and vice versa. 
44	
45	
Use of the masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter genders
46	
and is employed solely to facilitate reading.
47	
48	
2. Applicability
49	
50	
2.1. This Licence governs the use, copying, modification,
51	
communication to the public and distribution of the Documentation, and
52	
the manufacture and distribution of Products. By exercising any right
53	
granted under this Licence, the Licensee irrevocably accepts these
54	
terms and conditions.
55	
56	
2.2. This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to the Licensee,
57	
and shall apply worldwide and without limitation in time. The Licensee
58	
may assign his licence rights or grant sub-licences.
59	
60	
2.3. This Licence does not extend to software, firmware, or code
61	
loaded into programmable devices which may be used in conjunction with
62	
the Documentation, the modified Documentation or with Products, unless
63	
such software, firmware, or code is explicitly expressed to be subject
64	
to this Licence. The use of such software, firmware, or code is
65	
otherwise subject to the applicable licence terms and conditions.
66	
67	
3. Copying, modification, communication to the public and distribution
68	
of the Documentation
69	
70	
3.1. The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright and trademarks
71	
notices, all notices referring to Documentation Location, and all
72	
notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties
73	
that are included in the Documentation. He shall include a copy
74	
thereof in every copy of the Documentation or, as the case may be,
75	
modified Documentation, that he communicates to the public or
76	
distributes.
77	
78	
3.2. The Licensee may copy, communicate to the public and distribute
79	
verbatim copies of the Documentation, in any medium, subject to the
80	
requirements specified in section 3.1.
81	
82	
3.3. The Licensee may modify the Documentation or any portion thereof
83	
provided that upon modification of the Documentation, the Licensee
84	
shall make the modified Documentation available from a Documentation
85	
Location such that it can be easily located by an original Licensor
86	
once the Licensee communicates to the public or distributes the
87	
modified Documentation under section 3.4, and, where required by
88	
section 4.1, by a recipient of a Product. However, the Licensor shall
89	
not assert his rights under the foregoing proviso unless or until a
90	
Product is distributed.
91	
92	
3.4. The Licensee may communicate to the public and distribute the
93	
modified Documentation (thereby in addition to being a Licensee also
94	
becoming a Licensor), always provided that he shall:
95	
96	
a) comply with section 3.1;
97	
98	
b) cause the modified Documentation to carry prominent notices stating
99	
that the Licensee has modified the Documentation, with the date and
100	
description of the modifications;
101	
102	
c) cause the modified Documentation to carry a new Documentation
103	
Location notice if the original Documentation provided for one;
104	
105	
d) make available the modified Documentation at the same level of
106	
abstraction as that of the Documentation, in the preferred format for
107	
making modifications to it (e.g. the native format of the CAD tool as
108	
applicable), and in the event that format is proprietary, in a format
109	
viewable with a tool licensed under an OSI-approved license if the
110	
proprietary tool can create it; and
111	
112	
e) license the modified Documentation under the terms and conditions
113	
of this Licence or, where applicable, a later version of this Licence
114	
as may be issued by CERN.
115	
116	
3.5. The Licence includes a non-exclusive licence to those patents or
117	
registered designs that are held by, under the control of, or
118	
sub-licensable by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of
119	
the rights granted under this Licence. The scope of this section 3.5
120	
shall be strictly limited to the parts of the Documentation or
121	
modified Documentation created by the Licensor.
122	
123	
4. Manufacture and distribution of Products
124	
125	
4.1. The Licensee may manufacture or distribute Products always
126	
provided that, where such manufacture or distribution requires a
127	
licence under this Licence the Licensee provides to each recipient of
128	
such Products an easy means of accessing a copy of the Documentation
129	
or modified Documentation, as applicable, as set out in section 3.
130	
131	
4.2. The Licensee is invited to inform any Licensor who has indicated
132	
his wish to receive this information about the type, quantity and
133	
dates of production of Products the Licensee has (had) manufactured
134	
135	
5. Warranty and liability
136	
137	
5.1. DISCLAIMER – The Documentation and any modified Documentation are
138	
provided "as is" and any express or implied warranties, including, but
139	
not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory
140	
quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a
141	
particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of the
142	
Documentation, the modified Documentation or any Product. The Licensor
143	
makes no representation that the Documentation, modified
144	
Documentation, or any Product, does or will not infringe any patent,
145	
copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The entire risk as
146	
to the use, quality, and performance of a Product shall be with the
147	
Licensee and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an
148	
essential part of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any
149	
rights granted under this Licence. The Licensee warrants that it does
150	
not act in a consumer capacity.
151	
152	
5.2. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY – The Licensor shall have no liability
153	
for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,
154	
punitive or other damages of any character including, without
155	
limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use,
156	
data or profits, or business interruption, however caused and on any
157	
theory of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product
158	
liability or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the
159	
Documentation, modified Documentation and/or the use, manufacture or
160	
distribution of a Product, even if advised of the possibility of such
161	
damages, and the Licensee shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless
162	
from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including
163	
claims by third parties, in relation to such use.
164	
165	
6. General
166	
167	
6.1. Except for the rights explicitly granted hereunder, this Licence
168	
does not imply or represent any transfer or assignment of intellectual
169	
property rights to the Licensee.
170	
171	
6.2. The Licensee shall not use or make reference to any of the names
172	
(including acronyms and abbreviations), images, or logos under which
173	
the Licensor is known, save in so far as required to comply with
174	
section 3. Any such permitted use or reference shall be factual and
175	
shall in no event suggest any kind of endorsement by the Licensor or
176	
its personnel of the modified Documentation or any Product, or any
177	
kind of implication by the Licensor or its personnel in the
178	
preparation of the modified Documentation or Product.
179	
180	
6.3. CERN may publish updated versions of this Licence which retain
181	
the same general provisions as this version, but differ in detail so
182	
far this is required and reasonable. New versions will be published
183	
with a unique version number.
184	
185	
6.4. This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect, upon written
186	
notice and without involvement of a court if the Licensee fails to
187	
comply with any of its terms and conditions, or if the Licensee
188	
initiates legal action against Licensor in relation to this
189	
Licence. Section 5 shall continue to apply.

## Comments for manufacturing the kit with Seeed Studio
### LoNet 808
- LoNET 808 should come come with GPS and Phone antenna, does it?
- Header connector pins should be attached, can it be?
- LoNET 808 Power LED can be low power / skipped as it drains battery

### Comments for manufacturing PCBs
- PCBs to soldered
- PCBs to be Eco / Recycled PCBs / wood PCB

### Comments for sourcing batteries
- Battery 3000 mA/h, type: 18650, ideally Panasonic and cheap
- Can you make sure the batteries are 100% charged?
- Solder wires to the batteries (15cm) with connector mounted

### Comments for sourcing battery charger
- We need to charge 110 devices over 11 events. If we can charge 6 batteries at the time: great.

## Ask about
- Availabilites?
- Timeline?
- Bulk pricing?
- Overall budget?
